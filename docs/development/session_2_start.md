# Session 2 Start

**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Session Number:** 2
**Task:** Create EPIC-001 from ngx-support-chat-specification.md

## Goals This Session

1. Analyze ngx-support-chat-specification.md to identify logical implementation phases
2. Create EPIC-001 document with task breakdown
3. Define task dependencies and milestones
4. Establish success criteria for the entire epic

## Starting Point

- Fresh session, no active task
- Specification document already read (1659 lines)
- Need to decompose into manageable tasks

## Planned Approach

1. Identify major implementation phases from spec:
   - Foundation (workspace, models, tokens)
   - Core components (container, messages, message area)
   - Interactive elements (quick replies, typing, input)
   - Features (virtual scroll, accessibility)
   - Styling (CSS tokens, themes, container queries)
   - Demo & packaging (demo app, schematics, CI)

2. Create EPIC-001 with detailed task plans
3. Define dependencies between tasks
4. Estimate complexity for each task
