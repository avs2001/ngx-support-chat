# Session 2 End

**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Session Number:** 2
**Task:** Create EPIC-001 from ngx-support-chat-specification.md

---

## Accomplishments

1. **Created comprehensive EPIC-001** with 11 tasks across 6 phases
2. **Analyzed full specification** (1659 lines) and mapped to implementation tasks
3. **Established task dependencies** and milestone structure
4. **Set up SDP tracking documents** for ongoing implementation

---

## What Was NOT Completed

- No implementation work (expected - this was planning session)
- TASK-001 not started (next session)

---

## Blockers Discovered

None.

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Action | Lines |
|------|--------|-------|
| docs/project_tasks/EPIC-001-ngx-support-chat.md | Created | ~450 |
| docs/development/session_2_start.md | Created | ~35 |
| docs/development/implementation_status.md | Created | ~55 |
| docs/development/handoff_notes.md | Created | ~45 |
| docs/development/session_2_end.md | Created | ~50 |

---

## Key Decisions

1. **11 tasks** - Right granularity for tracking without over-engineering
2. **Phase structure** - Foundation first, then build up component hierarchy
3. **Dependencies** - Linear dependency chain with TASK-004/005 being parallelizable after TASK-003

---

## Next Session Should

1. Start TASK-001: Project Foundation & Workspace Setup
2. Create Angular CLI workspace
3. Configure all tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest)
4. Verify build pipeline works
